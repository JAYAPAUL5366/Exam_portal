    <p>The Standard Template Library (STL) is a set of C++ template classes to provide common programming data structures and functions such as lists, stacks, arrays, etc. It is a library of container classes, algorithms, and iterators. It is a generalized library and so, its components are parameterized. 
     A working knowledge of template classes is a prerequisite for  
     working with STL.</p> 
     <p>STL has Four components</p> 
     <ul> 
     <li>Algorithms</li> 
     <li>Containers</li> 
     <li>Functions</li> 
     <li>Iterators</li>

    <p>A computer program is a collection of instructions to perform a specific task. For this, a computer program may need to store data, retrieve data, and perform computations on the data. 
     A data structure is a named location that can be used to store and organize data. And, an algorithm is a collection of steps to solve a particular problem. Learning data  
     and algorithms allow us to write efficient and optimized  
     computer programs.</p> 
     <p>Following are some famous topic of DSA</p>

    <p>When we talk about Competitive Programming, we can’t ignore the significance of Mathematics here. Yes, it is true that one can get started with competitive programming without any mathematical background, but it is also an unbeatable fact that having good command over several specific mathematical concepts gives you the much-needed advantage over others while solving the programming problems. There are numerous maths concepts, formulas, and theorems that help you to solve the  
    question while doing competitive programming within the necessary time constraints.</p> 
    <p>Following are the topics of mathmatiics for cp</p>

    <li>Prime Numbers<li>GCD and LCM<li>Modular Operation 
    <li>Catalan Number<li>Combinational Game Theory
